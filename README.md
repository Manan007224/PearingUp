# PearingUp
## Problem
People in Canada have trees (with fruits) outside their houses. During the Spring and Summer, those fruits fall down and no one picks them up. It's a total waste of food. 

## How this app will help
The main purpose of this application is to get people free food and to stop the wasting of food. People can post advertisments for the fruits (i.e. they have this tree outside their house) and people who are interested can come and grab those fruits for free.
